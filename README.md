I originally created this game as a part of the annual Hungry Hungry Hackers competition that I'm a part of.  Essentially it was to serve as an elaborate (and hopefully compelling) premise for a challenge.  I removed the parts that were essential to the competition <cough> intentional bugs </cough>, and here it is as a stand alone game.
